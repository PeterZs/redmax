Links are created one by one with respect to a parent link
The first link should not have a parent link and will act as the grounded link
Links must be created in order (you cannot attach a link to one that does not exist yet)
To specify a linkage in input.txt follow the format below
#link
name string			# required
dens double			# required - the density g/(cm*cm)
size double double double		# required
prnt string			# if this is left out, or left blank, this link will be a root linkage- there should only be one root
cpos double double double		# required, if the block does not have a parent then this defines the global position of the link
ppos double double double		# translates the joint position from the origin of the parent link
angl double			# defined as a multiple of pi, e.g. <angl 0.5> will produce a 90 degree clockwise rotation
type TJype			# defaults to ball joint
<invisible>			# if this token appears the block will be set to invisible (in the link-by-link scheme often the root link should be invisible)
<physics>			# if physics appears on a line the corresponding linkage will have a disconnected inertial block
angl double			# if defined after the physics token this will rotate the inertial block
axis double double double			# axis of rotation
dirn				# direction of effect
cpos double double double		# if defined after the physics token this will translate the inertial block
stif				# joint stiffness
damp				# joint damping
bdmp				# body damping

#spring
lnka string			# required
lnkb string			# required
posa double double double			# required, defaults to zero (center of mass)
posb double double double			# required, defaults to zero (center of mass)
rest double			# defaults to current distance (calculated on the fly)
stif double			# defaults to 0
damp double			# defaults to 0

#closejoint
lnka string			# required
lnkb string			# required
posa double double double			# required, defaults to zero (center of mass)
posb double double double			# required, defaults to zero (center of mass)
axis double double double			# axis of rotation
rest double			# rest angle
stif double			# defaults to 0
damp double			# defaults to 0

#springpoint
lnka string			# required
posa double double double			# required, defaults to zero (center of mass)
axis double double double			# axis of rotation
stif double			# defaults to 0

#spline 			# currently only supports one spline****
prnt string			# required, every spline must be matched to a point on a joint
type string			# defaults to cubic b-spline
ppos double double double		# translates the ciritical position from the origin of the parent link
double double double			# adds a critical point to the spline definition -- must be in order
